# Binary-Tree
Custom implementation of a binary tree in C++, with demo using Raylib

## Building
The demo program uses Raylib, and looks for raylib.lib in the raylib projects build directory.
This is to say build the raylib project before running the program.

## Usage
The textbox will accept numerical input of upto 9 digits, and is cleared after use. It does not have to be selected to be used.
The insert button will add a node of the input value onto the tree, given that value doesnt already exist.
The remove button will remove the node of the input value, given it exists.
